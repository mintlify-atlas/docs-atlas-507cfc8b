## Core features

### Intelligent mode detection
**Auto mode detection** classifies videos as dance or gym and re-themes the entire UI with flashy overlays and mode-specific coaching personalities.

### Real-time pose scoring
**Geometric comparison** against reference frames blended with Groq vision scoring, EMA-smoothed at 30fps for jitter-free feedback.

### Dynamic score popups
**PERFECT (+25), GREAT (+20), OK (+15), ALMOST (+10), MISS (0)** flash on screen with particle effects, accumulating to a total points counter.

### Combo streak system
**Every 5th consecutive non-miss hit** triggers a gold streak celebration with visual effects and bonus points.

### AI coaching with personality
**OpenAI LLM** watches your pose summary every few seconds and gives personality-driven audio feedback via TTS. Different coaching styles for dance (hype) vs gym (strict form).

### Hands-free gesture controls
**Raise both hands** to pause/play — no keyboard needed during your workout.

### Person segmentation
**Isolates the dancer** from the background using Modal's SAM2 model for cleaner reference tracking.

### AI video generation
**Describe a workout or dance** and it generates a custom video using Perplexity research → GPT-4o synthesis → Grok video generation.

### Performance analytics
**4-slide Spotify Wrapped-style report card** with letter grade (S/A/B/C/D), per-limb breakdown, AI persona analysis, and improvement tips.

### Move queue timeline
**Scrolling timeline** of key poses extracted from the video, synchronized with playback position.

### Chrome extension
**One-click import** sends the current YouTube tab URL directly to the app.

## How scoring works

Jiggle Wiggle blends three scoring signals per frame:

| Signal | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Geometric pose comparison | 50-80% | Compares your landmark positions against the closest reference frame using angle and distance matching per limb |
| Groq vision scoring | 40% | Periodic screenshot comparison (reference vs webcam) scored by Groq's vision model |
| Heuristic body metrics | 10-20% | Arm height, symmetry, motion energy, torso angle |

Final score is EMA-smoothed with alpha 0.15 and a dead zone of 2 to suppress jitter. Frame hits are detected when the video passes each key pose timestamp, converting the smoothed score to a tier.

### Performance grades

| Grade | Average Score | Feedback Style |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| S | 78+ | Maximum hype and celebration |
| A | 62+ | Strong encouragement |
| B | 45+ | Constructive feedback |
| C | 30+ | Motivational with corrections |
| D | &lt;30 | Playful roasting with improvement focus |

The grade is computed from data. The headline, persona, roasts, and tips are generated by GPT-4o-mini with tone that scales to performance.
