# Improving Your Scores

Jiggle Wiggle scores every move in real-time, giving you instant feedback and a final grade at the end. This guide explains how scoring works and how to improve your performance to earn those satisfying PERFECT hits and top-tier grades.

## Understanding the Scoring System

### How Scores Are Calculated

Your score is computed using three weighted signals blended together:

| Signal | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Geometric pose comparison** | 50-80% | Compares your landmark positions against reference frames using angle and distance matching per limb |
| **Groq vision scoring** | 40% | Periodic screenshot comparison between reference video and your webcam, scored by AI vision |
| **Heuristic body metrics** | 10-20% | Arm height, body symmetry, motion energy, torso angle, and other form factors |

<Note>
Scores are EMA-smoothed with alpha 0.15 and a 2-point dead zone to reduce jitter and make your score feel stable.
</Note>

### Score Tiers and Points

When you hit a key pose in the video, you'll see a popup with:

| Tier | Score Required | Points Awarded |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **PERFECT** | 90+ | +25 points |
| **GREAT** | 80-89 | +20 points |
| **OK** | 60-79 | +15 points |
| **ALMOST** | 40-59 | +10 points |
| **MISS** | Under 40 | 0 points |

<Tip>
Every 5th consecutive non-MISS hit triggers a gold streak celebration! Build combos to maximize your points and excitement.
</Tip>

## Final Grade Breakdown

At the end of your session, you'll receive a letter grade based on your average score:

| Grade | Average Score Required | Meaning |
|-------|------------------------|----------|
| **S** | 78+ | Outstanding! The AI coach hypes you up |
| **A** | 62-77 | Great performance with solid technique |
| **B** | 45-61 | Good effort, room for improvement |
| **C** | 30-44 | Needs work, coach gives constructive feedback |
| **D** | Under 30 | Coach provides motivational roasts and tips |

<Note>
Your grade comes with a Spotify Wrapped-style performance report featuring your headline, AI persona, per-limb breakdown, and personalized improvement tips.
</Note>

## Key Factors That Affect Your Score

### 1. Pose Confidence (Baseline)

Your score starts at 70, then adjusts based on performance:

**Visibility penalty**:
- Average landmark visibility below 50% → **-15 points**
- Caused by: poor lighting, going off-frame, or occlusion

<Tip>
Maintain good lighting and stay fully in frame. This is the foundation of high scores.
</Tip>

### 2. Arm Position and Height

**Arm height scoring**:
- Wrists **below shoulders** by more than 15% of frame height → **-10 points**
- The AI prioritizes arm movements as key choreography signals

**Arm symmetry**:
- Wrists **uneven** by more than 18% of frame height → **-8 points**
- Many dance moves require balanced arm positions

<Tip>
Raise your arms high and keep them level! Arm movements are heavily weighted in the scoring algorithm.
</Tip>

### 3. Motion Energy

The system tracks your keypoint velocity over 3-frame windows:

**Too still**:
- Average displacement < 0.008 → **-12 points**
- "Not moving enough" feedback from coach

**Too chaotic**:
- Average displacement > 0.12 → **-8 points**
- "Moving too chaotically" feedback from coach

**Just right**:
- Smooth, purposeful movement → **+10 points**

<Note>
The sweet spot is controlled, energetic movement. Dance with intention, not random motion.
</Note>

### 4. Body Metrics

Additional factors tracked in your pose summary:

- **Torso lean**: Horizontal offset between shoulders and hips
- **Knee bend**: Relative position of knees to hips
- **Body symmetry**: Left/right limb positioning

These metrics feed into the AI coach's feedback and influence your overall score.

## Strategies for Higher Scores

### Start With the Basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Perfect Your Setup">
    Before focusing on choreography:
    - Ensure excellent lighting (no "Low pose confidence" warnings)
    - Position yourself at the right distance (full body in frame)
    - Choose a clean background
    - Test your skeleton overlay (all joints visible)
    
    See [Pose Detection Tips](/guides/pose-detection-tips) for detailed setup guidance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Choose the Right Video">
    For learning and high scores:
    - Start with slower, clearer choreography
    - Choose videos with distinct arm movements
    - Pick 30-60 second clips for focused practice
    - Use mirrored tutorial videos
    
    See [Using YouTube Videos](/guides/using-youtube-videos) for selection tips.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Master Playback Controls">
    Use the video player tools:
    - Slow down to **0.5x speed** while learning
    - Set A/B loop markers to repeat difficult sections
    - Jump back 10 seconds to retry moves
    - Use gesture controls (raise both hands) to pause without breaking flow
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Movement Technique

#### Arm Movements
**Arms are crucial** for high scores:

✅ **Do**:
- Raise arms to at least shoulder height
- Keep arm movements symmetric when choreography requires it
- Extend arms fully for dramatic gestures
- Hold positions briefly to register the pose

❌ **Avoid**:
- Lazy arm placement below shoulders
- One arm higher than the other without intention
- Half-extended arms (commit to the movement!)
- Rushing through arm transitions

#### Motion Quality
**Move with purpose**:

✅ **Do**:
- Match the energy level of the reference video
- Execute smooth, controlled movements
- Hit key poses clearly before transitioning
- Maintain consistent movement throughout

❌ **Avoid**:
- Standing still or barely moving
- Flailing wildly without matching the choreo
- Skipping key poses in the sequence
- Inconsistent energy (starting strong, fading out)

<Tip>
Watch the move queue timeline at the bottom to anticipate upcoming poses. Being ready for each transition improves your timing and scores.
</Tip>

#### Body Position
**Stay visible and aligned**:

✅ **Do**:
- Keep your full body in frame at all times
- Face the camera directly
- Maintain upright torso posture
- Execute low moves (squats) within camera view

❌ **Avoid**:
- Turning completely sideways
- Leaning so far the torso leaves frame
- Going too low and cutting off at the knees
- Drifting left/right out of center

## Working With the AI Coach

### Understanding Coaching Feedback

The AI coach watches your pose summary every few seconds and gives personality-driven audio feedback:

**Common coach callouts**:
- "Arms too low" → Raise your arms above shoulder height
- "Not moving enough" → Increase your motion energy
- "Arms uneven" → Balance your left and right arm positions
- "Low pose confidence" → Check your lighting or stay in frame

<Note>
The coach has personality modes that scale with performance. S/A grades get hype and encouragement, C/D grades get motivational roasts and specific improvement tips.
</Note>

### Using Feedback to Improve

1. **Listen during practice**: The coach provides real-time guidance
2. **Adjust immediately**: Fix issues as soon as they're called out
3. **Read your report card**: Review the 4-slide performance summary
4. **Focus on worst limb**: The report shows per-limb breakdown
5. **Replay hard sections**: Use the "Replay hardest part" button

<Tip>
The AI coach maintains conversation history (last 6 exchanges) and throttles to one call per 3 seconds. It learns your patterns and gives contextual advice.
</Tip>

## Advanced Scoring Tactics

### Building Combo Streaks

**Streak mechanics**:
- Every **non-MISS** hit counts toward your streak (ALMOST and up)
- Every **5th consecutive hit** triggers a gold streak celebration
- Streaks reset on MISS scores

**Strategy for long streaks**:
1. Start with simpler sections to build momentum
2. Use slower playback speed (0.75x) to reduce errors
3. Focus on consistency over perfection initially
4. Gradually increase speed as you master the routine

### Maximizing Points

**Point optimization**:
- **PERFECT hits (90+)** give maximum points (+25)
- Even a score of 89 is GREAT (+20), a 5-point difference
- Focus on the high-impact factors: arms up, good energy, stay in frame

**Priority for points**:
1. Fix "Low pose confidence" issues first (biggest penalty: -15)
2. Raise your arms (second biggest penalty: -10)
3. Increase motion energy if too still (penalty: -12)
4. Balance arm symmetry if needed (penalty: -8)

<Tip>
Going from GREAT (80) to PERFECT (90) requires only 10 more points. Often this is just "arms higher" + "slightly more energy."
</Tip>

### Targeting S-Rank (78+ Average)

To consistently hit S-rank:

- **Setup perfectly**: Zero lighting/framing penalties
- **Arms always high**: Eliminate the -10 arm height penalty
- **Smooth, energetic movement**: Get the +10 motion bonus
- **Match key poses precisely**: High geometric comparison score
- **Practice repeatedly**: Familiarity improves timing and positioning
