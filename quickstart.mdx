## Your first coaching session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Paste a YouTube URL">
    On the home page, paste a YouTube URL of a dance or workout video. Short clips (30-60 seconds) work best.

    <Tip>
    Try a popular TikTok dance tutorial or a simple workout video for your first session.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Allow camera access">
    When prompted, grant webcam permissions. The app needs your camera for real-time pose detection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    The app will:
    - Download the video (30-60 seconds)
    - Classify it as dance or gym mode
    - Extract poses from the reference video (~10 seconds)
    - Apply person segmentation (optional, can be skipped)

    You'll see progress indicators for each step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start moving!">
    - Press play on the video
    - Follow along with the moves
    - Watch your score appear in real-time:
      - **PERFECT** (90+): +25 points
      - **GREAT** (80+): +20 points
      - **OK** (60+): +15 points
      - **ALMOST** (40+): +10 points
      - **MISS** (&lt;40): 0 points
  </Step>

  <Step title="View your report">
    When the video ends, you'll see a Spotify Wrapped-style performance report with:
    - Letter grade (S/A/B/C/D)
    - Per-limb breakdown
    - AI-generated persona and feedback
    - Improvement tips
  </Step>
</Steps>
