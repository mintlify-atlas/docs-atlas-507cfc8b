## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Video Input">
    Paste any YouTube URL or use AI Generate to create a custom workout/dance video
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pose Extraction">
    MediaPipe Pose extracts key frames from the reference video at 10fps, creating a timeline of target poses
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Real-Time Tracking">
    Your webcam feed is analyzed at 30fps using MediaPipe Pose for skeleton detection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scoring & Feedback">
    Multi-signal scoring system evaluates your performance with:
    - Geometric pose comparison (50-80% weight)
    - Groq vision AI scoring (40% weight)
    - Motion heuristics (10-20% weight)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Coaching">
    OpenAI LLM monitors your pose summary every 3-5 seconds and provides live audio feedback via TTS
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Performance Report">
    When the video ends, receive a 4-slide Spotify Wrapped-style report with grades, per-limb analysis, and tips
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Metrics

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Frame Rate
// Real-time scoring runs at 30fps
const SCORING_FPS = 30;
const FRAME_INTERVAL = 1000 / SCORING_FPS; // ~33ms
```

```typescript Pose Extraction
// Reference video processed at 10fps
const EXTRACTION_FPS = 10;
const FRAME_INTERVAL = 0.1; // seconds
```

```typescript AI Coach
// Adaptive interval based on performance
function getAdaptiveInterval() {
  if (trend === "declining" || score < 40) return 3500; // 3.5s
  if (score >= 80) return 5500; // 5.5s
  return 4500; // 4.5s default
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## What Makes It Unique

<Note>
  **Choreography-Agnostic Design**
  
  Unlike traditional dance apps that require pre-programmed choreography, Jiggle Wiggle works with ANY YouTube video. The pose extraction and comparison system adapts to whatever moves are in the video.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Multi-Signal Scoring**
  
  Combines three different scoring approaches (geometric, vision AI, and heuristics) for robust evaluation that works across different body types and camera angles.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Anti-Repetition AI Coach**
  
  The coach uses Jaccard similarity detection, style rotation, and delta tracking to ensure every piece of feedback is unique and contextual.
