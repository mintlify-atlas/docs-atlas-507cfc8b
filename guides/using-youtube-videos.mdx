# Using YouTube Videos

Jiggle Wiggle works with any YouTube dance or workout video, but some videos will give you a better training experience than others. This guide will help you choose the right videos and get the most out of your practice sessions.

## Choosing the Best Videos

### Video Length

For the best training experience, choose videos that are:

- **30-60 seconds**: Ideal for focused practice and quick feedback loops
- **Under 3 minutes**: Good for learning complete routines without fatigue
- **Short clips over long videos**: Break down longer choreographies into segments

<Tip>
Shorter videos let you practice specific moves repeatedly and see faster improvement in your scores.
</Tip>

### Video Quality Matters

The AI can better analyze and compare your movements when the reference video has:

- **Well-lit dancer**: Clear visibility of body positions and limb movements
- **Clean background**: Reduces visual noise during pose extraction
- **Single dancer in frame**: Multiple people can confuse the pose detection
- **Full body visible**: Shows complete movements from head to feet
- **Stable camera**: Minimal camera shake or rapid cuts

### Best Video Types

#### Excellent Choices
- Dance tutorials with clear, repeated movements
- TikTok choreography videos (short, popular, recognizable)
- Workout routines with distinct poses
- Mirrored dance videos (easier to follow along)

#### Challenging Choices
- Music videos with rapid cuts and camera movements
- Performance videos with dramatic lighting changes
- Videos with multiple dancers or background performers
- Extremely fast-paced routines (harder to match timing)

## Using Short-Form Videos

YouTube Shorts and TikTok reuploads are perfect for Jiggle Wiggle:

- Quick to download and process
- Easy to master in one session
- Great for building combos and streaks
- Perfect for focused skill practice

<Note>
The app automatically detects whether your video is a dance or gym workout and adjusts the UI theme accordingly.
</Note>

## Video Processing Tips

### First-Time Setup

When you paste a YouTube URL:

1. **Wait for download**: Videos are processed server-side (typically under 60 seconds)
2. **Watch for mode detection**: The app will classify your video as dance or gym
3. **Let pose extraction complete**: The app analyzes key frames from the video
4. **Check the move queue**: Scroll through extracted poses to preview the routine

### Video Playback Features

Once your video is loaded, you can:

- **Adjust playback speed**: Slow down to 0.5x for learning, speed up to 1.5x for challenge
- **Use gesture controls**: Raise both hands to pause/play without touching your keyboard
- **Practice in segments**: The system tracks your performance throughout
