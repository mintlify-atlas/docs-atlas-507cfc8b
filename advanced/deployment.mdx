description: Deploy Jiggle Wiggle to various platforms including Docker, Render, and other hosting providers
---

Jiggle Wiggle can be deployed to various platforms. This guide covers deployment options and platform-specific instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Required API keys (see [Environment Variables](/advanced/environment-variables))
- System dependencies: `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`

## Docker Deployment

The recommended deployment method is using Docker, which handles all system dependencies automatically.

### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t jiggle-wiggle .
```

### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_... \
  -e XAI_API_KEY=xai-... \
  -e PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=... \
  jiggle-wiggle
```

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  jiggle-wiggle:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - GROQ_API_KEY=${GROQ_API_KEY}
      - XAI_API_KEY=${XAI_API_KEY}
      - PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}
      - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}
    volumes:
      - /tmp/jigglewiggle:/tmp/jigglewiggle
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Render Deployment

Jiggle Wiggle includes a `render.yaml` configuration for easy deployment to Render.

### Using the Render Blueprint

1. Fork the Jiggle Wiggle repository
2. Connect your GitHub account to Render
3. Create a new Web Service from your fork
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` configuration
5. Set the required environment variables in the Render dashboard

### Manual Render Setup

If not using the blueprint:

1. Create a new **Web Service** on Render
2. Select **Docker** as the runtime
3. Set the region (e.g., Oregon)
4. Configure environment variables (see [Environment Variables](/advanced/environment-variables))
5. Deploy

## Vercel Deployment

<Warning>
Vercel deployment has limitations due to serverless function constraints. Docker deployment is recommended for production use.
</Warning>

Jiggle Wiggle uses system dependencies (`yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`) that are not available in Vercel's serverless environment by default. You'll need to:

1. Use the Vercel CLI: `vercel deploy`
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Note that video download and processing may have timeouts on the hobby plan

## Platform-Specific Notes

### System Dependencies

All platforms must have `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` installed and available on the PATH:

- **Docker**: Handled automatically by the Dockerfile
- **Render**: Install via `render.yaml` build commands or Docker runtime
- **VPS/Bare Metal**: Install manually:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg python3-pip
sudo pip3 install yt-dlp

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg yt-dlp
```

### Video Storage

Videos are stored in `/tmp/jigglewiggle/` by default. On serverless platforms, this directory is ephemeral and cleared between deployments.

For persistent storage, consider:

- Mounting a volume (Docker)
- Using object storage (S3, R2, etc.)
- Modifying `VIDEO_DIR` in the API routes

### Port Configuration

The application runs on port 3000 by default. Configure via environment variables:

```bash
PORT=8080
HOSTNAME="0.0.0.0"
```

## Health Checks

Verify the deployment is working:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

Test the video download endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/download \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"videoId":"dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'
```

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set all required environment variables
- [ ] Verify `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are installed
- [ ] Test webcam permissions on your domain (HTTPS required)
- [ ] Configure CORS if using a separate frontend
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Review API rate limits for OpenAI, Groq, and xAI
- [ ] Test the full user flow: download → pose extraction → scoring → report
